Wanted to learn about procedural mesh generation. Made a simple game out of it. Thanks to Freya Holmer for an awesome introduction of mesh generation.

The most challenging part of this game was "Mesh Pooling" :)
If you want to see in action, just play and notice the "Scene view", you will know what I am talking about.
